# Getting Started with Task Management App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and has been customized for a Task Management application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Recommended version: 14.x or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (npm comes bundled with Node.js)

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/neyugndz/Task-Management-App.git
    cd task-management-app
    ```

2. **Install dependencies** using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes, and you may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed! See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!** 

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project, copying all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project for full control. All commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts.

You do not have to use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature.
